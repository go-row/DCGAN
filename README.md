# DCGAN-
<h1>Generate Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Keras.</h1>
<h2>Objectives :<h2>
<ol>
    <li>Implement a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).</li>
    <li>Train a DCGAN to synthesize realistic looking images.</li>
<ol>
<p>The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos or audio.</p>

<p> Implemented a network which is structured, trained, and will ultimately generate synthetic images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST dataset.</p>
